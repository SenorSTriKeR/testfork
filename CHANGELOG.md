# cloudflarepycli@2.0.0

## Refactor

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** separate library and logging functionality

  - "your ip" -> "ip"
  - "your ISP" -> "isp"

  - "test location region" -> "location_region"
  - "latency ms" -> "latency"
  - "Jitter ms" -> "jitter"
  - "{x} download Mbps" -> "{x}_down_bps"
  - "{x} upload Mbps" -> "{x}_up_bps"
  - "90th percentile download Mbps" -> "90th_percentile_down_bps"
  - "90th percentile upload Mbps" -> "90th_percentile_up_bps"
